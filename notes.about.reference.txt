Hi Serghei,

Matteo is right that I have done a lot of RNA-Seq in Chlamydomonas. I wasn't privy to the earlier conversation, and I don't know what genome assembly you are using.  

The keeper of the most up-to-date assembly and annotations is the JGI. Their current genome is at v5.0 (Creinhardtii_281_v5.0.softmasked.fa.gz). The current annotations are at v5.5 (Creinhardtii_281_v5.5.gene.gff3.gz), although there is a pre-release of the next version available (v5.6) there too. Unless there is another reason to use something else, I would get those files from the JGI and use them. You shouldn't have any problems with agreement between that assembly and annotation file.

Here is the link to download those files from the JGI:

Cheers,
